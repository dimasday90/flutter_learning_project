# flutter_learning_project

A new Flutter project.

I created this project as a learning app to explore basics in Flutter + Dart programming language.

## Getting Started

**Pre-Requisite**

- Flutter SDK
- Android Studio (AVD to use android emulator) or Xcode if using MacOS
- If using Visual Studio Code, install Flutter and Dart Plugin
- If using other IDE, make sure to install Flutter and Dart compatible to the IDE

**Run Project**

- in root folder, run this command `flutter run` in terminal
- the easiest way to run is using run debug (F5) or if in other IDE, just click `Run` button

**Other Sources**

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:
